Rip me off?? grow the fuck up. 
NTV is no longer online and i will NOT be threatened into sharing my work for others to remove my signature and take credit.
The "Fuck Them Time to Learn" group are bullies and are definately not welcome Any where near the kodi "community" 

For the record ive never removed a dev signature on any of my modified skins or addons further i have never and will never charge for Kodi or a build

I see everything. And others will too.
